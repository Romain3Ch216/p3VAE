#    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
#    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

#    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
#    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
#    as of the date such litigation is filed.

# 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
#    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
#    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

#    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
#    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
#    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
#    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

# 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
#    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
#    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

#    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
#    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
#    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
#    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

#    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

# 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
#    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
#    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
#    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
#    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
#    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
#    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
#    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
#    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
